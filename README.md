# El Santo GDScript Library
A GDScript Library that offers tools to solve the most common problems related to game development. 

## Intalation 
If you plan to use this inside your projects you wil need to run the following commands

(ssh) 
```
git submodule add git@github.com:batomow/El-Santo.git master
git commit -m "Adds El-Santo Submodule" 
git submodule update --init --recursive 
```

I recommend this [link](https://github.blog/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/) to learn how to work with submodules.
